# Soft Deletes

Soft deletes are a way to "delete" a record without actually removing it from the database.
This is useful for keeping a record of the data that was deleted, and for maintaining referential integrity
in the database.

To enable this feature you need to define a field named `deleted_at` in your table **and**
create a Object Mapper that supports this field.

## How to Enable Soft Delete

Once you define a FieldMapping to the `deleted_at` field, Repository class will automatically filter the records 
that have this field equals null. 

There is some ways to define the field `deleted_at`:

### Using the `DeletedAt` trait in your model

```php
<?php
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Attributes\FieldAttribute;
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Attributes\TableAttribute;
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Trait\DeletedAt;

#[TableAttribute(tableName: 'my_table')]
class MyModel
{
    use DeletedAt;

    #[FieldAttribute(fieldName: 'id', primaryKey: true)]
    public ?int $id;

    #[FieldAttribute(fieldName: 'name')]
    public ?string $name;
}
```

### Using the `FieldAttribute` annotation

```php
<?php
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Attributes\FieldAttribute;
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Attributes\TableAttribute;

#[TableAttribute(tableName: 'my_table')]
class MyModel
{
    #[FieldAttribute(fieldName: 'id', primaryKey: true)]
    public ?int $id;

    #[FieldAttribute(fieldName: 'name')]
    public ?string $name;

    #[FieldAttribute(fieldName: 'deleted_at', syncWithDb: false)]
    public ?string $deletedAt;
}
```

### Using the `FieldMap` class

```php
<?php
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Mapper;
use ByJG\MicroOrm\Mapper\FieldMapper;
use ByJG\MicroOrm\MapperFunctions;

class MyModel
{
    public ?int $id;
    public ?string $name;
    public ?string $deletedAt;
}

// Creating the mapping
$mapper = new Mapper(
    MyModel::class,   // The full qualified name of the class
    'my_table',        // The table that represents this entity
    'id'            // The primary key field
);

// Optionally you can define table mappings between the propoerties
// and the database fields;
// The example below will map the property 'createdate' to the database field 'created';
$mapper->addFieldMapping(
    FieldMap::create('deletedAt')
        ->withFieldName('deleted_at')
        ->withUpdateFunction(MapperFunctions::READ_ONLY));

```

## Disabling Soft Delete Temporarily

Once one of the methods above is used, the soft delete is enabled by default. If you want to disable it temporarily
you can add to your query the argument `unsafe()`.

```php
<?php
$query = Query::getInstance();

// This will not return the records are marked as deleted 
$query->table('my_table');
    
// This will return all records, including the ones marked as deleted
$query->table('my_table')->unsafe();
```
